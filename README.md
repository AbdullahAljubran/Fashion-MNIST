Project Description
This web application performs image clustering using machine learning techniques. It utilizes Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, followed by both K-Means and DBSCAN clustering algorithms to classify uploaded images. The application provides a user-friendly interface built with Streamlit that displays the clustering results in an elegant format.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

**Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
```
Install the required packages:
```
pip install streamlit opencv-python numpy scikit-learn joblib pillow
```


Usage
Run the application:
```
streamlit run app.py
```
The application will open in your default web browser at http://localhost:8501

Upload an image using the file uploader

View the results:

Your uploaded image displayed in a styled frame

K-Means cluster assignment

DBSCAN cluster assignment (or outlier detection)

How It Works
Image Processing:

Converts image to grayscale

Resizes to 28x28 pixels

Flattens and normalizes pixel values

Dimensionality Reduction:

Uses PCA to reduce features while preserving variance

Clustering:

K-Means: Assigns to nearest cluster centroid

DBSCAN: Density-based clustering that can identify outliers

Results Display:

Presents both clustering results in formatted boxes
